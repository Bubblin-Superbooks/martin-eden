<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Back from sea Martin Eden came, homing for California with a lover&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; His store of money exhausted, he had shipped before the mast on the treasure-hunting schooner; and the Solomon Islands, after eight months of failure to find treasure, had witnessed the breaking up of the expedition.&nbsp; The men had been paid off in Australia, and Martin had immediately shipped on a deep-water vessel for San Francisco.&nbsp; Not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many weeks, but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and reading.</p><p>His was the student&rsquo;s mind, and behind his ability to learn was the indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth.&nbsp; The grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it.</p></div> </div>
