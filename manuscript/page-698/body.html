<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having learned such precautions, Martin consulted &ldquo;The Duchess&rdquo; for tone, and proceeded to mix according to formula.&nbsp; The formula consists of three parts: (1) a pair of lovers are jarred apart; (2) by some deed or event they are reunited; (3) marriage bells.&nbsp; The third part was an unvarying quantity, but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times.&nbsp; Thus, the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives, by accident of fate, by jealous rivals, by irate parents, by crafty guardians, by scheming relatives, and so forth and so forth; they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover, by a similar deed of the woman lover, by change of heart in one lover or the other, by forced confession of crafty guardian, scheming relative, or jealous rival, by voluntary confession of same, by discovery of some unguessed secret, by lover storming girl&rsquo;s heart, by lover making long and noble self-sacrifice, and so on, endlessly.</p></div> </div>
