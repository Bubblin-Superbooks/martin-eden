<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It was the first time in his life that Martin had travelled first class.&nbsp; On ships at sea he had always been in the forecastle, the steerage, or in the black depths of the coal-hold, passing coal.&nbsp; In those days, climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat, he had often caught glimpses of the passengers, in cool white, doing nothing but enjoy themselves, under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them, with subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim, and it had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their being was nothing else than paradise.&nbsp; Well, here he was, the great man on board, in the midmost centre of it, sitting at the captain&rsquo;s right hand, and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke-hole in quest of the Paradise he had lost.&nbsp; He had found no new one, and now he could not find the old one.</p></div> </div>
