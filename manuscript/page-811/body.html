<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Beauty is the only master to serve.&nbsp; Serve her and damn the multitude!&nbsp; Success!&nbsp; What in hell&rsquo;s success if it isn&rsquo;t right there in your Stevenson sonnet, which outranks Henley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apparition,&rsquo; in that &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; in those sea-poems?</p><p>&ldquo;It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy, but in the doing of it.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t tell me.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; You know it.&nbsp; Beauty hurts you.&nbsp; It is an everlasting pain in you, a wound that does not heal, a knife of flame.&nbsp; Why should you palter with magazines?&nbsp; Let beauty be your end.&nbsp; Why should you mint beauty into gold?&nbsp; Anyway, you can&rsquo;t; so there&rsquo;s no use in my getting excited over it.&nbsp; You can read the magazines for a thousand years and you won&rsquo;t find the value of one line of Keats.</p></div> </div>
