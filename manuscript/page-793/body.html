<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Brissenden&rsquo;s face and long, slender hands were browned by the sun&mdash;excessively browned, Martin thought.&nbsp; This sunburn bothered Martin.&nbsp; It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor man.&nbsp; Then how had he been ravaged by the sun?&nbsp; Something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn, was Martin&rsquo;s thought as he returned to a study of the face, narrow, with high cheek-bones and cavernous hollows, and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline nose as Martin had ever seen.&nbsp; There was nothing remarkable about the size of the eyes.&nbsp; They were neither large nor small, while their color was a nondescript brown; but in them smouldered a fire, or, rather, lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory.&nbsp; Defiant, indomitable, even harsh to excess, they at the same time aroused pity.&nbsp; Martin found himself pitying him he knew not why, though he was soon to learn.</p></div> </div>
