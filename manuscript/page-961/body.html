<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin shook his head, but gave no explanations.&nbsp; How could he explain?&nbsp; He was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him and his people.&nbsp; He could never cross it and explain to them his position,&mdash;the Nietzschean position, in regard to socialism.&nbsp; There were not words enough in the English language, nor in any language, to make his attitude and conduct intelligible to them.&nbsp; Their highest concept of right conduct, in his case, was to get a job.&nbsp; That was their first word and their last.&nbsp; It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas.&nbsp; Get a job!&nbsp; Go to work!&nbsp; Poor, stupid slaves, he thought, while his sister talked.&nbsp; Small wonder the world belonged to the strong.&nbsp; The slaves were obsessed by their own slavery.&nbsp; A job was to them a golden fetich before which they fell down and worshipped.</p></div> </div>
