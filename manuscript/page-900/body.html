<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to Brissenden&rsquo;s advice and command.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; he wrapped and mailed to The Acropolis.&nbsp; He believed he could find magazine publication for it, and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him to the book-publishing houses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine.&nbsp; Despite Brissenden&rsquo;s prejudice against the magazines, which was a pronounced mania with him, Martin decided that the great poem should see print.&nbsp; He did not intend, however, to publish it without the other&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high magazines, and, thus armed, again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent.</p></div> </div>
