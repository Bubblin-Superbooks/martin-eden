<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation.&nbsp; She was stunned.&nbsp; He was apathetic.&nbsp; Once, he mentioned that he was going away, back to the South Seas, and, once, she asked him to forgive her having come to him.&nbsp; And that was all.&nbsp; The parting at her door was conventional.&nbsp; They shook hands, said good night, and he lifted his hat.&nbsp; The door swung shut, and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his hotel.&nbsp; When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman shrink, he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor.</p><p>&ldquo;She lied,&rdquo; he said aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;She made believe to me that she had dared greatly, and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was waiting to take her back.&rdquo;&nbsp; He burst into laughter.</p></div> </div>
