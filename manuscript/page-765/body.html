<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When I begin to feel drowsy, I change the heavy book I am reading for a lighter one.&nbsp; And when I doze over that, I beat my head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away.&nbsp; Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid to sleep.&nbsp; Kipling wrote the story.&nbsp; This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came, his naked body pressed against the iron teeth.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve done the same.&nbsp; I look at the time, and I resolve that not until midnight, or not until one o&rsquo;clock, or two o&rsquo;clock, or three o&rsquo;clock, shall the spur be removed.&nbsp; And so it rowels me awake until the appointed time.&nbsp; That spur has been my bed-mate for months.&nbsp; I have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance.&nbsp; I sleep four hours now.&nbsp; I am starved for sleep.</p></div> </div>
