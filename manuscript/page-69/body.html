<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires, in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love-calls of the singers, who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom-toms.&nbsp; It was a sensuous, tropic night.&nbsp; In the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars.&nbsp; Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon, and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky.</p><p>He was a harp; all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings; and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams.&nbsp; He did not merely feel.&nbsp; Sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance, and what his imagination dared, it objectified in some sublimated and magic way.</p></div> </div>
