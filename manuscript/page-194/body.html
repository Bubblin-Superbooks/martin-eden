<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Several weeks went by, during which Martin Eden studied his grammar, reviewed the books on etiquette, and read voraciously the books that caught his fancy.&nbsp; Of his own class he saw nothing.&nbsp; The girls of the Lotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with questions, and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley&rsquo;s were glad that Martin came no more.&nbsp; He made another discovery of treasure-trove in the library.&nbsp; As the grammar had shown him the tie-ribs of language, so that book showed him the tie-ribs of poetry, and he began to learn metre and construction and form, beneath the beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty.&nbsp; Another modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art, treated it exhaustively, with copious illustrations from the best in literature.</p></div> </div>
