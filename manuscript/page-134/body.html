<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.&nbsp; He was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his life with a giant&rsquo;s grasp.&nbsp; He could not steel himself to call upon her.&nbsp; He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette.&nbsp; He spent long hours in the Oakland and Berkeley libraries, and made out application blanks for membership for himself, his sisters Gertrude and Marian, and Jim, the latter&rsquo;s consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses of beer.&nbsp; With four cards permitting him to draw books, he burned the gas late in the servant&rsquo;s room, and was charged fifty cents a week for it by Mr. Higginbotham.</p></div> </div>
