<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; You belong with the legions of toil, with all that is low, and vulgar, and unbeautiful.&nbsp; You belong with the oxen and the drudges, in dirty surroundings among smells and stenches.&nbsp; There are the stale vegetables now.&nbsp; Those potatoes are rotting.&nbsp; Smell them, damn you, smell them.&nbsp; And yet you dare to open the books, to listen to beautiful music, to learn to love beautiful paintings, to speak good English, to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks, to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!&nbsp; Who are you? and what are you? damn you!&nbsp; And are you going to make good?</p></div> </div>
