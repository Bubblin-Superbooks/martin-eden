<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A plague on all their houses!&rdquo; was Brissenden&rsquo;s answer to Martin&rsquo;s volunteering to market his work for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love Beauty for its own sake,&rdquo; was his counsel, &ldquo;and leave the magazines alone.&nbsp; Back to your ships and your sea&mdash;that&rsquo;s my advice to you, Martin Eden.&nbsp; What do you want in these sick and rotten cities of men?&nbsp; You are cutting your throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of magazinedom.&nbsp; What was it you quoted me the other day?&mdash;Oh, yes, &lsquo;Man, the latest of the ephemera.&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, what do you, the latest of the ephemera, want with fame?&nbsp; If you got it, it would be poison to you.&nbsp; You are too simple, too elemental, and too rational, by my faith, to prosper on such pap.&nbsp; I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines.</p></div> </div>
