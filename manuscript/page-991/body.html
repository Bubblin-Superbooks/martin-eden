<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Parthenon came out in its next number patting itself on the back for the stir it had made, sneering at Sir John Value, and exploiting Brissenden&rsquo;s death with ruthless commercialism.&nbsp; A newspaper with a sworn circulation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem by Helen Della Delmar, in which she gibed and sneered at Brissenden.&nbsp; Also, she was guilty of a second poem, in which she parodied him.</p><p>Martin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead.&nbsp; He had hated the crowd so, and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had been thrown to the crowd.&nbsp; Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on.&nbsp; Every nincompoop in the land rushed into free print, floating their wizened little egos into the public eye on the surge of Brissenden&rsquo;s greatness.</p></div> </div>
