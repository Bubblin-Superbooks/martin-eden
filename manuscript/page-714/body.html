<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a penny-dreadful purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl,&rdquo; a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines, just finished, white hot from his brain, won the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a great railroad.&nbsp; When the editor wrote, offering him payment in transportation, Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable.&nbsp; It was not, and so, being prevented from peddling it, he asked for the return of the poem.&nbsp; Back it came, with the editor&rsquo;s regrets, and Martin sent it to San Francisco again, this time to The Hornet, a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it.</p></div> </div>
