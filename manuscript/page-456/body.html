<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Monday morning Joe was wild with anticipation.&nbsp; He did not mind his aching head, nor did he take interest in his work.&nbsp; Whole herds of moments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out of the window at the sunshine and the trees.</p><p>&ldquo;Just look at it!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s all mine!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s free.&nbsp; I can lie down under them trees an&rsquo; sleep for a thousan&rsquo; years if I want to.&nbsp; Aw, come on, Mart, let&rsquo;s chuck it.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of waitin&rsquo; another moment.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the land of nothin&rsquo; to do out there, an&rsquo; I got a ticket for it&mdash;an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t no return ticket, b&rsquo;gosh!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
