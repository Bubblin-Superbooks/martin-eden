<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Encouraged by his several small sales, Martin went back to hack-work.&nbsp; Perhaps there was a living in it, after all.&nbsp; Stored away under his table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short-story syndicate.&nbsp; He read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper storiettes, and so doing, reasoned out the perfect formula.&nbsp; He found that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic, should never end unhappily, and should never contain beauty of language, subtlety of thought, nor real delicacy of sentiment.&nbsp; Sentiment it must contain, plenty of it, pure and noble, of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from &ldquo;nigger heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;For-God-my-country-and-the-Czar&rdquo; and &ldquo;I-may-be-poor-but-I-am-honest&rdquo; brand of sentiment.</p></div> </div>
