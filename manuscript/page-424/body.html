<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin learned to do many things.&nbsp; In the course of the first week, in one afternoon, he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts.&nbsp; Joe ran the tiler, a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure.&nbsp; By this means he ironed the yoke, wristbands, and neckband, setting the latter at right angles to the shirt, and put the glossy finish on the bosom.&nbsp; As fast as he finished them, he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin, who caught them up and &ldquo;backed&rdquo; them.&nbsp; This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts.</p><p>It was exhausting work, carried on, hour after hour, at top speed.&nbsp; Out on the broad verandas of the hotel, men and women, in cool white, sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down.</p></div> </div>
