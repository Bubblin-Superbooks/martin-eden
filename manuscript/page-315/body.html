<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>some childish notions, a few half-baked sentiments, a lot of undigested beauty, a great black mass of ignorance, a heart filled to bursting with love, and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance.&nbsp; And you wanted to write!&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re just on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about.&nbsp; You wanted to create beauty, but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty?&nbsp; You wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life.&nbsp; You wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence.&nbsp; But cheer up, Martin, my boy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll write yet.</p></div> </div>
