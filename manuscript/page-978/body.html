Put by the lute.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Maria could stand it no longer, and hurried away to the stove, where she filled a quart-bowl with soup, putting into it the lion&rsquo;s share of chopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; Martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat, between spoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking in his sleep and that he did not have any fever.</p></div> </div>
