<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A year ago I believed for two years.&nbsp; One of those years is yet to run.&nbsp; And I do believe, upon my honor and my soul, that before that year is run I shall have succeeded.&nbsp; You remember what you told me long ago, that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing.&nbsp; Well, I have served it.&nbsp; I have crammed it and telescoped it.&nbsp; With you at the end awaiting me, I have never shirked.&nbsp; Do you know, I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep.&nbsp; A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep.&nbsp; I am awakened always now by an alarm clock.&nbsp; If I fall asleep early or late, I set the alarm accordingly; and this, and the putting out of the lamp, are my last conscious actions.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
