<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could not have been made at a more opportune moment.&nbsp; A fierce controversy was precipitated.&nbsp; Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended &ldquo;The Shame of the Sun,&rdquo; for once finding themselves on the same side of a question.&nbsp; Crookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side, while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic theories.&nbsp; Maeterlinck&rsquo;s followers rallied around the standard of mysticism.&nbsp; Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged non-partisan essays on the subject, and the whole affair, controversy and controversialists, was well-nigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from George Bernard Shaw.&nbsp; Needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights, and the dust and sweat and din became terrific.</p></div> </div>
