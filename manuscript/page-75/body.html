<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As Martin Eden went down the steps, his hand dropped into his coat pocket.&nbsp; It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican tobacco, which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette.&nbsp; He drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he said aloud, in a voice of awe and wonder.&nbsp; &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; And yet again he murmured, &ldquo;By God!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then his hand went to his collar, which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket.&nbsp; A cold drizzle was falling, but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest, swinging along in splendid unconcern.&nbsp; He was only dimly aware that it was raining.&nbsp; He was in an ecstasy, dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past.</p></div> </div>
