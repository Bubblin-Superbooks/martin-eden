<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ruth pressed her mother&rsquo;s hand in assent, feeling that she really did understand, though her conception was of something vague, remote, and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination.</p><p>&ldquo;You know I do nothing without telling you,&rdquo; she began.&nbsp; &ldquo;&mdash;Only, sometimes you must ask me, like this time.&nbsp; I wanted to tell you, but I did not know how.&nbsp; It is false modesty, I know it is that, but you can make it easy for me.&nbsp; Sometimes, like this time, you must ask me, you must give me a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, mother, you are a woman, too!&rdquo; she cried exultantly, as they stood up, catching her mother&rsquo;s hands and standing erect, facing her in the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk.&nbsp; I had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one, too.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
