<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Early one evening, struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain, Martin was called to the telephone.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s voice, a fine lady&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Mr. Higginbotham, who had called him, jeered.</p><p>Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room, and felt a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; In his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence, and at the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow.&nbsp; And such a voice!&mdash;delicate and sweet, like a strain of music heard far off and faint, or, better, like a bell of silver, a perfect tone, crystal-pure.&nbsp; No mere woman had a voice like that.&nbsp; There was something celestial about it, and it came from other worlds.</p></div> </div>
