<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A third week went by, and Martin loathed himself, and loathed life.&nbsp; He was oppressed by a sense of failure.&nbsp; There was reason for the editors refusing his stuff.&nbsp; He could see that clearly now, and laugh at himself and the dreams he had dreamed.&nbsp; Ruth returned his &ldquo;Sea Lyrics&rdquo; by mail.&nbsp; He read her letter apathetically.&nbsp; She did her best to say how much she liked them and that they were beautiful.&nbsp; But she could not lie, and she could not disguise the truth from herself.&nbsp; She knew they were failures, and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line of her letter.&nbsp; And she was right.&nbsp; He was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over.&nbsp; Beauty and wonder had departed from him, and as he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind when he wrote them.</p></div> </div>
