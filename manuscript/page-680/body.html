<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Is there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law of evolution?&mdash;Oh, I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various arts laid down, but it seems to me to be too mechanical.&nbsp; The human himself is left out.&nbsp; The evolution of the tool, of the harp, of music and song and dance, are all beautifully elaborated; but how about the evolution of the human himself, the development of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered his first chant?&nbsp; It is that which you do not consider, and which I call biology.&nbsp; It is biology in its largest aspects.</p><p>&ldquo;I know I express myself incoherently, but I&rsquo;ve tried to hammer out the idea.&nbsp; It came to me as you were talking, so I was not primed and ready to deliver it.</p></div> </div>
