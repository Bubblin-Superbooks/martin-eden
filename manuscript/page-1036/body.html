<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;The Shame of the Sun&rdquo; was published in October.&nbsp; As Martin cut the cords of the express package and the half-dozen complimentary copies from the publishers spilled out on the table, a heavy sadness fell upon him.&nbsp; He thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a few short months before, and he contrasted that delight that should have been with his present uncaring coldness.&nbsp; His book, his first book, and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat, and he was only sad.&nbsp; It meant little to him now.&nbsp; The most it meant was that it might bring some money, and little enough did he care for money.</p></div> </div>
