<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>at Tetralani, five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds, and at Barillo, a scant five feet four, greasy-featured, with the chest of a squat, undersized blacksmith, and at the pair of them, attitudinizing, clasping their breasts, flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum; and when I am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love-scene between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome, romantic, young prince&mdash;why, I can&rsquo;t accept it, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rot; it&rsquo;s absurd; it&rsquo;s unreal.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not real.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell me that anybody in this world ever made love that way.&nbsp; Why, if I&rsquo;d made love to you in such fashion, you&rsquo;d have boxed my ears.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
