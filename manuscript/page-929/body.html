<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It is because Socialism is inevitable; because the present rotten and irrational system cannot endure; because the day is past for your man on horseback.&nbsp; The slaves won&rsquo;t stand for it.&nbsp; They are too many, and willy-nilly they&rsquo;ll drag down the would-be equestrian before ever he gets astride.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t get away from them, and you&rsquo;ll have to swallow the whole slave-morality.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a nice mess, I&rsquo;ll allow.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s been a-brewing and swallow it you must.&nbsp; You are antediluvian anyway, with your Nietzsche ideas.&nbsp; The past is past, and the man who says history repeats itself is a liar.&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t like the crowd, but what&rsquo;s a poor chap to do?&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t have the man on horseback, and anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule.&nbsp; But come on, anyway.</p></div> </div>
