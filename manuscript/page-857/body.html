<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin&rsquo;s alienation from his family continued.&nbsp; Following upon Mr. Higginbotham&rsquo;s unprovoked attack, Mr. Hermann von Schmidt showed his hand.&nbsp; The fortunate sale of several storiettes, some humorous verse, and a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity.&nbsp; Not only did he partially pay up his bills, but he had sufficient balance left to redeem his black suit and wheel.&nbsp; The latter, by virtue of a twisted crank-hanger, required repairing, and, as a matter of friendliness with his future brother-in-law, he sent it to Von Schmidt&rsquo;s shop.</p><p>The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being delivered by a small boy.&nbsp; Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly, was Martin&rsquo;s conclusion from this unusual favor.&nbsp; Repaired wheels usually had to be called for.</p></div> </div>
