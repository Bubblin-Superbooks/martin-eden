But this kiss had tasted soapsuds, and the lips, he had noticed, were flabby.&nbsp; There had been no quick, vigorous lip-pressure such as should accompany any kiss.&nbsp; Hers was the kiss of a tired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss.&nbsp; He remembered her as a girl, before her marriage, when she would dance with the best, all night, after a hard day&rsquo;s work at the laundry, and think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day&rsquo;s hard work.&nbsp; And then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it resided in all about her.&nbsp; Her kiss would be like her hand-shake or the way she looked at one, firm and frank.</p></div> </div>
