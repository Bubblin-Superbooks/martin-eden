<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There are times when I am light-headed from want of sleep, times when death, with its rest and sleep, is a positive lure to me, times when I am haunted by Longfellow&rsquo;s lines:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sea is still and deep; All things within its bosom sleep; A single step and all is o&rsquo;er, A plunge, a bubble, and no more.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, this is sheer nonsense.&nbsp; It comes from nervousness, from an overwrought mind.&nbsp; But the point is: Why have I done this?&nbsp; For you.&nbsp; To shorten my apprenticeship.&nbsp; To compel Success to hasten.&nbsp; And my apprenticeship is now served.&nbsp; I know my equipment.&nbsp; I swear that I learn more each month than the average college man learns in a year.&nbsp; I know it, I tell you.&nbsp; But were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you.</p></div> </div>
