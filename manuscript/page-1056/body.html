<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin recollected his blank-verse tragedy, and sent it instead.&nbsp; He read it over before mailing, and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness.&nbsp; But he sent it; and it was published, to the everlasting regret of the editor.&nbsp; The public was indignant and incredulous.&nbsp; It was too far a cry from Martin Eden&rsquo;s high standard to that serious bosh.&nbsp; It was asserted that he had never written it, that the magazine had faked it very clumsily, or that Martin Eden was emulating the elder Dumas and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him.&nbsp; But when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary childhood, and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got it, a great laugh went up at the magazine&rsquo;s expense and a change in the editorship followed.</p></div> </div>
