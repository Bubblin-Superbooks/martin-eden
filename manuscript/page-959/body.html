<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>For Martin&rsquo;s troubles were many.&nbsp; The aftermath of the cub reporter&rsquo;s deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated.&nbsp; The Portuguese grocer refused him further credit, while the greengrocer, who was an American and proud of it, had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with him&mdash;carrying his patriotism to such a degree that he cancelled Martin&rsquo;s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it.&nbsp; The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling, and indignation against Martin ran high.&nbsp; No one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor.&nbsp; Poor Maria was dubious and frightened, but she remained loyal.&nbsp; The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin, and from safe distances they called him &ldquo;hobo&rdquo; and &ldquo;bum.</p></div> </div>
