<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day Martin became aware that he was lonely.&nbsp; He was healthy and strong, and had nothing to do.&nbsp; The cessation from writing and studying, the death of Brissenden, and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big hole in his life; and his life refused to be pinned down to good living in caf&eacute;s and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes.&nbsp; It was true the South Seas were calling to him, but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the United States.&nbsp; Two books were soon to be published, and he had more books that might find publication.&nbsp; Money could be made out of them, and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the South Seas.&nbsp; He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars.&nbsp; The valley ran from the horseshoe, land-locked bay to the tops of the dizzy, cloud-capped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres.</p></div> </div>
