<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole.&nbsp; Whether he had happened there just casually, intent on other affairs, or whether he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner, Martin never could quite make up his mind, though he inclined toward the second hypothesis.&nbsp; At any rate, invited to dinner he was by Mr. Morse&mdash;Ruth&rsquo;s father, who had forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement.</p><p>Martin was not angry.&nbsp; He was not even on his dignity.&nbsp; He tolerated Mr. Morse, wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie.&nbsp; He did not decline the invitation.&nbsp; Instead, he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and inquired after the family, particularly after Mrs. Morse and Ruth.</p></div> </div>
