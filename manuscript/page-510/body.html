<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This must be love, she thought, in the one rational moment that was vouchsafed her.&nbsp; If it was not love, it was too shameful.&nbsp; It could be nothing else than love.&nbsp; She loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers.&nbsp; She pressed more, tightly to him, with a snuggling movement of her body.&nbsp; And a moment later, tearing herself half out of his embrace, suddenly and exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden&rsquo;s sunburnt neck.&nbsp; So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan, relaxed her hands, and lay half-swooning in his arms.</p><p>Not a word had been spoken, and not a word was spoken for a long time.&nbsp; Twice he bent and kissed her, and each time her lips met his shyly and her body made its happy, nestling movement.</p></div> </div>
