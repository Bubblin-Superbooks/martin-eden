<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about, spasmodically and feebly.&nbsp; But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them beat and churn.&nbsp; He was too deep down.&nbsp; They could never bring him to the surface.&nbsp; He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision.&nbsp; Colors and radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him.&nbsp; What was that?&nbsp; It seemed a lighthouse; but it was inside his brain&mdash;a flashing, bright white light.&nbsp; It flashed swifter and swifter.&nbsp; There was a long rumble of sound, and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway.&nbsp; And somewhere at the bottom he fell into darkness.&nbsp; That much he knew.&nbsp; He had fallen into darkness.&nbsp; And at the instant he knew, he ceased to know.</p></div> </div>
