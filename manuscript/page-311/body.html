<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living, and here he was at a higher pitch than ever.&nbsp; All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare.&nbsp; He was drunken with comprehension.&nbsp; At night, asleep, he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare; and awake, in the day, he went around like a somnambulist, with absent stare, gazing upon the world he had just discovered.&nbsp; At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things, his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him.&nbsp; In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away, or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat, and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat, until, with inward gaze, he saw the same sun shining in his brain.</p></div> </div>
