<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t even have the words with which to think.&nbsp; My experiences were so many meaningless pictures.&nbsp; But as I began to add to my knowledge, and to my vocabulary, I saw something more in my experiences than mere pictures.&nbsp; I retained the pictures and I found their interpretation.&nbsp; That was when I began to do good work, when I wrote &lsquo;Adventure,&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Joy,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Pot,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Wine of Life,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Jostling Street,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Love-cycle,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Sea Lyrics.&rsquo;&nbsp; I shall write more like them, and better; but I shall do it in my spare time.&nbsp; My feet are on the solid earth, now.&nbsp; Hack-work and income first, masterpieces afterward.</p></div> </div>
