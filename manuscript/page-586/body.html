<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I understood that,&rdquo; Martin answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the arts have their conventions.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Ruth was surprised at his use of the word.&nbsp; It was as if he had studied at the university himself, instead of being ill-equipped from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library.)&nbsp; &ldquo;But even the conventions must be real.&nbsp; Trees, painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each side of the stage, we accept as a forest.&nbsp; It is a real enough convention.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, we would not accept a sea scene as a forest.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; It violates our senses.&nbsp; Nor would you, or, rather, should you, accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to-night as a convincing portrayal of love.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
