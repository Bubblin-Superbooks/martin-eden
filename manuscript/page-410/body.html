<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The next morning, at quarter-past six, Martin was routed out for a quarter-to-seven breakfast.&nbsp; There happened to be a bath-tub for the servants in the laundry building, and he electrified Joe by taking a cold bath.</p><p>&ldquo;Gee, but you&rsquo;re a hummer!&rdquo; Joe announced, as they sat down to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen.</p><p>With them was the engineer, the gardener, and the assistant gardener, and two or three men from the stable.&nbsp; They ate hurriedly and gloomily, with but little conversation, and as Martin ate and listened he realized how far he had travelled from their status.&nbsp; Their small mental caliber was depressing to him, and he was anxious to get away from them.&nbsp; So he bolted his breakfast, a sickly, sloppy affair, as rapidly as they, and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door.</p></div> </div>
