<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A preliminary editorial note quoted Sir John Value as saying that there were no poets in America, and the publication of &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was The Parthenon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, take that, Sir John Value!&rdquo;&nbsp; Cartwright Bruce was described as the greatest critic in America, and he was quoted as saying that &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo; was the greatest poem ever written in America.&nbsp; And finally, the editor&rsquo;s foreword ended with: &ldquo;We have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of &ldquo;Ephemera&rdquo;; perhaps we shall never be able to do so.&nbsp; But we have read it often, wondering at the words and their arrangement, wondering where Mr. Brissenden got them, and how he could fasten them together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then followed the poem.</p></div> </div>
