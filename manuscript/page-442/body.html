<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Martin drank on silently, biting out his orders and invitations and awing the barkeeper, an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair parted in the middle.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils,&rdquo; Joe was remarking.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t bowl up, I&rsquo;d break loose an&rsquo; burn down the shebang.&nbsp; My bowlin&rsquo; up is all that saves &rsquo;em, I can tell you that.&rdquo;</p><p>But Martin made no answer.&nbsp; A few more drinks, and in his brain he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl.&nbsp; Ah, it was living, the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks.&nbsp; His dreams came back to him.&nbsp; Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on, a thing of flaming brightness.&nbsp; His mirror of vision was silver-clear, a flashing, dazzling palimpsest of imagery.</p></div> </div>
