<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was a hard summer for Martin.&nbsp; Manuscript readers and editors were away on vacation, and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more.&nbsp; The consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected by the deadlock.&nbsp; Only the robber-publications seemed to remain actively in business, and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts, such as &ldquo;Pearl-diving,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sea as a Career,&rdquo; &ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Northeast Trades.&rdquo;&nbsp; For these manuscripts he never received a penny.&nbsp; It is true, after six months&rsquo; correspondence, he effected a compromise, whereby he received a safety razor for &ldquo;Turtle-catching,&rdquo; and that The Acropolis, having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions: for &ldquo;The Northeast Trades,&rdquo; fulfilled the second part of the agreement.</p></div> </div>
