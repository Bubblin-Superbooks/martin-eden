<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock; lowering storm-clouds covered the sky; and, outside the line of surf, a pilot-schooner, close-hauled, heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible, was surging along against a stormy sunset sky.&nbsp; There was beauty, and it drew him irresistibly.&nbsp; He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting, very close.&nbsp; The beauty faded out of the canvas.&nbsp; His face expressed his bepuzzlement.&nbsp; He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint, then stepped away.&nbsp; Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas.&nbsp; &ldquo;A trick picture,&rdquo; was his thought, as he dismissed it, though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick.&nbsp; He did not know painting.</p></div> </div>
