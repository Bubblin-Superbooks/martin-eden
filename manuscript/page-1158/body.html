<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The day the Mariposa entered the doldrums, Martin was more miserable than ever.&nbsp; He could no longer sleep.&nbsp; He was soaked with sleep, and perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life.&nbsp; He moved about restlessly.&nbsp; The air was sticky and humid, and the rain-squalls were unrefreshing.&nbsp; He ached with life.&nbsp; He walked around the deck until that hurt too much, then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again.&nbsp; He forced himself at last to finish the magazine, and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of poetry.&nbsp; But they could not hold him, and once more he took to walking.</p><p>He stayed late on deck, after dinner, but that did not help him, for when he went below, he could not sleep.&nbsp; This surcease from life had failed him.&nbsp; It was too much.</p></div> </div>
