<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Invitations to dinner poured in on Martin; and the more they poured, the more he puzzled.&nbsp; He sat, the guest of honor, at an Arden Club banquet, with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life; and they told him how, when they had read &ldquo;The Ring of Bells&rdquo; in the Transcontinental, and &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; in The Hornet, they had immediately picked him for a winner.&nbsp; My God! and I was hungry and in rags, he thought to himself.&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you give me a dinner then?&nbsp; Then was the time.&nbsp; It was work performed.&nbsp; If you are feeding me now for work performed, why did you not feed me then when I needed it?&nbsp; Not one word in &ldquo;The Ring of Bells,&rdquo; nor in &ldquo;The Peri and the Pearl&rdquo; has been changed.&nbsp; No; you&rsquo;re not feeding me now for work performed.</p></div> </div>
