<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth.&nbsp; Martin opened it with a premonition of disaster, and read it standing at the open door when he had received it from the postman.&nbsp; As he read, mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days.&nbsp; He was not aware that the pocket was empty or that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a cigarette.</p><p>It was not a passionate letter.&nbsp; There were no touches of anger in it.&nbsp; But all the way through, from the first sentence to the last, was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment.&nbsp; She had expected better of him.&nbsp; She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness, that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently.</p></div> </div>
