<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;From too much love of living, From hope and fear set free, We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods may be That no life lives forever; That dead men rise up never; That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>He looked again at the open port.&nbsp; Swinburne had furnished the key.&nbsp; Life was ill, or, rather, it had become ill&mdash;an unbearable thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;That dead men rise up never!&rdquo;&nbsp; That line stirred him with a profound feeling of gratitude.&nbsp; It was the one beneficent thing in the universe.&nbsp; When life became an aching weariness, death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep.&nbsp; But what was he waiting for?&nbsp; It was time to go.</p></div> </div>
